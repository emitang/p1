		<h1>Description</h1>
		<p>My name is Emily Tang and I'm approximately a second-year MIT student. I'm looking to major in Computer Science and either minor or also major in Linguistics. I was born in Virginia, but I've lived in Plano, Texas (a suburb of Dallas) for most of my life.</p>
		<h1>Course</h1>
		<p>I'm taking this course because I've studied lots of front-end coding for web development, but I haven't ever really looked closely at back-end, so I'm interested in learning more.</p>
		<h1>Programming</h1>
		<p>My previous programming experience includes knowledge of Java, some of the basics of Python, and experience with mainly front-end web development</p>
		<h1>Platform</h1>
		<p>I'm working on a Macbook Pro 13" from 2012 running OSX Mavericks 10.9.2</p>
		<h1>Other</h1>
		<p>I'm currently on a medical leave from MIT and taking some classes to get back on track for readmission.</p>
